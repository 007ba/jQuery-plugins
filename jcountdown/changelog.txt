Version 1.3.1:

- Some logic improved, meaning shorter code
- Removed unnecessary indenting
- Added new option, hoursOnly (boolean). Numbers of days left gets converted to hours and added to the number of hours left in the countdown
- Renamed function getTimeZoneDate to getTZDate
- Data name renamed from jcdSettings to jcdData
- Event namespace renamed from jcountdown to jcdevt
- Fixed bug: When changing settings of an existing countdown, time left doesn't update until next interval, when it should be straight away
- Fixed bug: When calling .countdown on an element that already has a countdown, another one gets added. Now it changes the settings.
- Fixed bug: When retrieving a boolean setting that is false, returns undefined instead.
- Fixed bug: Interval should be cleared when countdown destroyed.
